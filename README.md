- 👀 I’m interested in the most effective work, to elevate the possibilities and get things done.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Figma designs, builder.io, update of knowledge within angular signals.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects I've created first.
- 📫 How to reach me ? Reach me in my code.
- 😄 Pronouns: No tengo.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The UI development took half of my life to be happy with, however it's nowhere close to what can we do now with few clicks.
